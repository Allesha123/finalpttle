<p align="center"><font color="black">Nowadays, we are facing one of the biggest social issues in the world which is the COVID 19.<br>
Covid-19 pandemic has really chaged our lives.<br>
To those who are safe, we should continue to keep ourselves going.<br>
From my family to yours, we would like to send our love, support and gratitude to those who sacrifce their life just to save the many.<br> 
We are grateful that you all provided care for those people who are greatly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br> 
You put your live at stake, you put youself to be the bait and helps to those who need it.<br>
This pandemic destroyed our old normal life but together we will build it help each other to rise again ang continue fighting amidst the consequences. We know that we are not alone fighting,<br> 
we will be one... 
</p>
<p>
<p align="center"><h2>ALL WE NEED IS HOPE</h2>
</p>
<p>
<p align="center"><h3>"ONCE YOU CHOOSE HOPE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE" -CHRISTOPHER REEVE</h3><br></p>
When there is <i><b>HOPE</i></b> , anything can be sunny. When there is <i><b>HOPE</i></b> , future seems bright.<br>
When there is <i><b>HOPE</i></b> , everything becomes lighter.<br> When there is <i><b>HOPE</i></b> , everyone will have a positive outlook in life and have the determination to continue despite all the struggles.</p>
<p>
<p align="center"><font color="black">This message is for the people affected by the pandemic.<br> 
We all try to compensate for the stress, but sometimes life still feels like a mess.<br>
We find ways to turn negatives into good things and learn new skills that we never thought we could.<br>
Hope this year was full of opportunities and we tried to exercise and strengthen our immunity.<br>
2020 wasn't the way we expected it to be, but we found new ways to stay connected.<br>
Don't forget to pray and always be kind to try to stay positive and learn to relax.<br>
Always think positive and trust God.<br>
The story has been written, and in the end the prayers are good for all my family and friends.<br>
</p>

“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,<br>
and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore,<br>
for the former things have passed away.” (Revelation 21:4)

<p align="center"><h4>OUR PROJECT</h4>
<p align="center"><i>Dove has always been a symbol of hope.<br> 
Based on Noah's Ark returns after the flood is over and that was how they knew that there is land nearby.<br>
That was what gave them <b>HOPE</b>.<br>
Because of the dove, Noah had hopes that they will soon be safe in an island.<br>
In this drawing you would see a dove, because just like <b>NOAH</b> we have hopes that all of this crisis and troubles will soon come to an end.</i>
