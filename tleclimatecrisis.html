<p align="center"><font color"black">Climate crisis is a term describing <b>global warming</b> and <b>climate change</b>, and their consequences. 
The term has been used to describe the threat of global warming to the
planet, and to urge aggressive climate change mitigation.
For example, a January 2020 BioScience article endorsed by over 11,000 
scientists worldwide, stated that "the climate crisis has arrived" and 
that an "immense increase of scale in endeavors to conserve our biosphere is needed
to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis." The term 
is applied by those who "believe it evokes the gravity of the threats the planet
faces from continued greenhouse gas emissions and can help spur the
kind of political willpower that has long been missing from climate advocacy".</font color></p align="center">
<p>
<b><h1>DEFINITIONS:</h1></b>
<p>In the context of climate change, <b>Pierre Mukheibir, Professor of Water Futures at the University of
Technology Sydney</b>, states that the term crisis is "a crucial or decisive point or situation that could lead 
to a tipping point," one involving an "unprecedented circumstance." A dictionary definition states that "crisis"
in this context means "a turning point or a condition of instability or danger," and implies that "action needs to
be taken now or else the consequences will be disastrous." Another definition differentiates the term from 
global warming and climate change and defines climate crisis as "the various negative effects that 
unmitigated climate change is causing or threatening to cause on our planet, especially where these 
effects have a direct impact on humanity."

<p>
<b><h2>3 FACT TO KNOW ABOUT CLIMATE CRISIS</h2></b>
<p>
<b>1.CARBON POLLUTION IS DRIVING CLIMATE CHANGE</b><br>
-When carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted into our atmosphere, it can
 hang around for a very long time. The more carbon pollution in the air,
 the more the sun’s energy gets trapped in our atmosphere as heat. Think
 about it like this: a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
 acting like a blanket around the Earth. As more heat gets in and less is
 able to escape, things keep getting hotter, with real consequences for 
every element of our climate system.
<p>
<b>2.THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS MAKING WEATHER MORE EXTREME</b><br>
-“For a long time, we’ve understood, based on pretty simple physics,
 that as you warm the ocean’s surface, you’re going to get more intense
 hurricanes,” renowned climatologist Dr. Michael Mann explained to Climate
 Reality in October. “Whether you get more hurricanes or fewer hurricanes,
 the strongest storms will tend to become stronger. … Within the last three years,
 when global sea surface temperatures have been at their highest, we have seen the strongest hurricane globally,
 the strongest hurricane in the northern hemisphere, the strongest hurricane in the southern hemisphere,
 and the strongest storms in both the Pacific and the open Atlantic, with [Hurricane] Irma.”
And it’s not just hurricanes.
<p>
<b>3.IT ALSO IMPERILS PUBLIC HEALTH</b><br>
-As the planet continues to warm,
some vector-borne diseases and the environments in which certain microbes 
and diseases multiply are also expanding.
Extreme heat elevates the rate of death from illnesses like heart attack 
and heat stroke. And the same carbon pollution that causes climate change
can indirectly aggravate respiratory concerns like asthma and allergies by 
causing increased pollen production in certain plants.
